<center><h1> Multi REST API's web application </h1> </center> </br><p align="center"> <img width="300" src="assets/screenshots/Fetch.png"></p>
  
<div style="text-align: justify">
This web application was originally built using vanilla JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/ThiagoAndo/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-master.git">REST Countries API</a>. However, as with everything in life, growth and evolution are inevitable. To reflect my personal development, I decided to enhance the application by rebuilding it in React and integrating additional APIs to provide a more comprehensive user experience.
<br />
<br />
The updated version offers more detailed information about countries from the REST Countries API and also includes data about the user's location. I encountered many challenges along the way, but I also had a lot of fun developing this project.
<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy using the app as much as I enjoyed building it, and that you're able to learn something from it too. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me on X (formerly Twitter) at @Thiago09455827.
